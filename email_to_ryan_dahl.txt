Dear Ryan,

I wanted to reach out and thank you for creating Deno. It's been instrumental in building something I'm excited about - SAJ (Scheme As JSON), a self-programming agent that writes and executes its own programs.

SAJ is an AI system that doesn't just call predefined tools, but actually writes programs in a Lisp-like syntax represented as JSON. It can compute, fetch data, manipulate files, run shell commands, and even call itself recursively for complex reasoning. What makes it special is that it remembers and reuses the programs it writes, effectively building its own library over time.

Deno was the perfect foundation for this project. The built-in TypeScript support made development smooth, the security model with explicit permissions gave me confidence in letting an AI execute code, and the modern tooling meant I could focus on the core concept rather than fighting with build systems.

The combination of Deno's philosophy of simplicity and security with SAJ's self-programming capabilities feels like a glimpse into a future where AI systems can be both powerful and safely sandboxed.

Thank you for your vision and continued work on Deno. It's enabling new kinds of applications that weren't practical before.

Best regards,
[Your name]
